## BASH/SHELL SCRIPTING, projects && notes

### Bash projects
My first project(data-manipulation Folder) is composed of 4 bash files and 3 csv files one main entry(main.bash), to create a user (create-user.bash), to delete user (delete-user.bash), to list a  the user (see-all-user.bash). The 2 csv files serve as logs files, one to track all the command used saved as (command-history.csv) and a other one (error.csv) to track all the error and the last one to stored all user(data.bash).
Example:

```
./main.bash data.csv
```
output
```
File data: data.csv
